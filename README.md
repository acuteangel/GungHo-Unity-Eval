# GungHo-Unity-Eval

To play: Download and unzip repository. The game is in the Builds folder of the New Unity Project directory (Builds.app for MacOS).

For my assignment I decided to make a 2D platformer. I decided to use the provided robot model for the player character. The design of the robot gave me the idea to make his movement feel stiff and clunky. I used this element to add challenge and frustration to the levels.

My custom shader is named TintOutlineDiffuse.shader, or it can be found under Custom/DiffuseOutline in the custom shaders. Included in its inspector is the ability to enable/disable the Color, the Outline, or the Diffuse effect. 

I've also left in the folder of reference shaders, which I used to better understand how to write my own shader.
